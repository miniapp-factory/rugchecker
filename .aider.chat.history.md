App Name: RugChecker

Description / Functions (paste into Mini App Factory):

RugChecker is a security-focused mini app that analyzes Base network tokens and identifies potential rug-pull indicators. The app helps users understand smart contract risks before buying or interacting with a token.

Core Features:
 1. Smart Contract Risk Scan
 • Analyze any token contract on Base.
 • Detect common rug-pull signals such as:
• Ownership not renounced
• High admin privileges
• Trading restrictions
• Blacklist / whitelist functions
• Ability to mint unlimited tokens
• Hidden honeypot mechanics
 2. Risk Score (0–100)
 • Provide a simple score showing how risky the token is.
 • 0 = extremely dangerous, 100 = very safe
 • Categorize results: Safe / Caution / High Risk.
 3. Liquidity Analysis
 • Check whether liquidity is locked.
 • Show LP lock duration if available.
 • Flag tokens with removable or zero liquidity.
 4. Developer Wallet Check
 • Detect if a developer wallet holds a large percentage of supply.
 • Highlight wallets that could dump on users.
 5. User-Friendly Verdict
 • Short verdict:
• “Safe to explore”
• “Proceed with caution”
• “Likely rug — avoid”
 • Provide a simple list of reasons for the verdict.
 6. Quick Query Mode
 • Users can input a token address to instantly scan it.
 • Example: “Scan this contract: 0x123…”

Purpose:
RugChecker helps users avoid scams by providing transparent, quick, and simple smart contract analysis on Base.

Style:
Clear, direct, safety-first.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` constants.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to generate the app logo.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A stylized shield with a bold white 'R' centered inside, symbolizing security and protection. The shield is rendered in a gradient of deep blue and vibrant green, with a subtle metallic texture. The background is a light gray gradient that gives depth without distraction. The overall design is modern, clean, and conveys a sense of trust and safety for a security-focused app logo.
